## Women in IT workshop

### Introduction to programming in JavaScript with p5

#### Why should I learn to code?

Very tricky, but personal question - on that only you can answer.
I hope that the workshop will help someone develop an answer and I believe
that learning to code - opens new possibilites for exploration and
self expression.

#### What is p5?

JS library developed by Lauren McCarthy and backed by the Processing Foundation.
It provides easy way for making images, animations and interactions.

### Idea

- write a line of code and have a rectangle
- add a few more lines and we have a robot
- add a few more and it follows the mouse
- line here and there and we have a snake-alike-game
